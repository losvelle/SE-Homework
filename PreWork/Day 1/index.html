<!-- Paragraph about myself -->
            <p>
                My name is Carlos Velez I was born in the Bronx, New York to
                Dominican Parents. I speak spanish fluently and moved to massachussets
                3 years ago by myself to try to make something of myself. It's been
                a grind but I think that with your guys help I can make it. So thank
                you for taking the time out to teach us this new skill.
            </p>

            <p>
                P.S. I wonder if there are any keyboard shortcuts
                to atom. Which can make me write code a bit
                quicker. Also if there are any plugins that
                can help my code look a bit more organized. Something similar to
                Java or Python.
            </p>
